GitHub Copilot Chat allows you to ask questions about implementation through prompts, but the high burden of typing these prompts one by one has led to the following issues:

- **Time and Productivity Issues**
  - Frequent prompt input interrupts coding, leading to decreased concentration and productivity.
  - Re-explaining the context takes time, resulting in inefficient workflows.
- **Quality and Consistency Issues**
  - Short prompts may not fully convey the developer's intent, leading to lower quality and appropriateness of the generated code.
  - Using different prompts can result in inconsistent code styles and policies, compromising the overall unity of the project.

Promptis is a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) Extension that semi-automates prompt execution using GitHub Copilot Chat to solve these issues.

## Merits

- **Reduced Prompt Input Effort**: Automatic execution of prompts reduces manual input tasks, allowing you to focus on development.
- **Consistent Code Reviews**: Unified prompts improve the quality and consistency of code reviews.
- **Faster Feedback**: Automatic execution of prompts speeds up code reviews and feedback, shortening the development cycle.

## How to Install

### Installing via the Internet

Please install from Promptis on [Extensions for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode).

- [Promptis - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tis.promptis)

### Installing on a Device Without Internet Access

1. Using a device with internet access, download the `.vsix` file, which is the actual extension, from the [Release](https://github.com/Fintan-contents/promptis/releases) page.
2. Distribute the downloaded `.vsix` file to the device without internet access.
3. On the device without internet access, install the `vsix` file from the "Extensions" menu in VS Code by selecting "Install from VSIX".
    - For more details, refer to [Install from a VSIX](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix).

## Usage

Promptis is an extension that semi-automates prompt execution using GitHub Copilot Chat.

Prepare prompts for review perspectives on source code and configuration files as Markdown files in a directory. You can issue commands to @promptis from the Chat window to execute the corresponding prompts continuously. For example, to review whether `chatHandler.ts` and `api.ts` meet the code standards, you would instruct as follows:

```text
@promptis /codereviewCodeStandards #file:chatHandler.ts #file:api.ts
```

The `/codereviewCodeStandards` command corresponds 1:1 with the prompt storage directory, and Promptis recursively reads and executes the prompt files (extension: `.md`) under that directory.

The commands you can instruct are as follows:

### Command Map

|Command Name| Execution Content|
|:-|:-|
|`codereviewCodeStandards` | Conduct a series of code reviews on code standards |
|`codereviewFunctional` | Conduct a code review from a functional perspective |
|`codereviewNonFunctional` | Conduct a code review from a non-functional perspective |
|`reverseEngineering` | Conduct reverse engineering on the source code |
| `drawDiagrams` | Create diagrams from the source code |

For prompt examples, please refer to our [Generative AI Engineering Utilization Guide](https://fintan-contents.github.io/gai-dev-guide/prompts). The compressed files can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Fintan-contents/gai-dev-guide/releases).

### Chat Variables

The [chat variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat#_chat-context) such as `#file` and `#selection` available in GitHub Copilot Chat can be used as is.  
In Promptis, you can also use the following chat variables:

| Chat Variable | Description | Example |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `#dir:[Directory]` | By including `#dir` in the prompt, you can specify the directory to which the prompt will be applied. The prompt will be executed on all files under the specified directory. You can also directly specify the directory in the format `#dir:path/to/dir`. | `@promptis /codereviewCodeStandards #dir` |
| `#filter:[GlobPattern]` | By including `#filter:[GlobPattern]` in the prompt, you can narrow down the files extracted by the `#dir` specification to only those that match the GlobPattern. For the patterns that can be specified, refer to [GlobPattern](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#GlobPattern). | `@promptis /codereviewCodeStandards #dir #filter:**/*.{ts,js}`

## Requirements

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [version.1.91.0](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_91) or later
  - To use Chat and Language Model API
- The following extensions must be installed:
  - [GitHub Copilot Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
  - [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)

## Telemetry

This extension collects usage data and sends telemetry to our server for the purpose of improving this extension. The collected data is as follows and does not include personally identifiable information.

|Item Name|Description|Example|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Executed Command|Command name indicated in the "Command Map" above|`codereviewCodeStandards`|
|Language Setting|User's VS Code language setting|`en`|
|VS Code Version|User's VS Code version|`1.94.1`|
|OS|User's OS|`linux`|
|Extension ID|ID of this extension| `tis.promptis`|
